  <Expandable title="What is a Space?" default-open="false">
    A space acts as a container for related documentation. You group docs by project, team, or topic to maintain clarity. Access controls apply at the space level for secure collaboration. For example, create a space for `API Docs` to house all endpoint references.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Version Control" default-open="true">
    Paperguide tracks every edit with automatic versioning. You revert to previous versions or compare changes side-by-side. This ensures no information is lost during iterative updates. Integrate with Git for advanced workflows if needed.
